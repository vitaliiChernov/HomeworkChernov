Python was conceived in the late 1980 by Guido van Rossum
at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica CWI in the Netherlands 
as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was 
inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling 
and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
Its implementation began in December 1989. 
Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, 
as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced 
his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Python's 
benevolent dictator for life, a title the Python community 
bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as 
the project's chief decision-maker. 
In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a 
five-member Steering Council to lead the project.
